# CS-210-Project-Three

1) This program displays the item frequncy data of CornerGrocery. The program reads an input file containing items, counts their occurrences, and allows users to search for the frequency of an individual item, and displays the items and thier frequencies.
2) I believe I did well on on structuring the code clearly and organizing it into a modular design. The use of classes,  allowed me to  to track items and their frequencies in an organized manner
3) I can enhance my code by adding  better error handling for user input, ensuring that invalid menu choices or item names are caught and handled.
4) The most challenging part for me was getting the histogram to display properly. I managed to get it working through mostly trial and error while also getting some help from online sources such as stack overflow.
5) Skills from this project that I will be able to use on future projects are file handling and working with input/output streams.
6) I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following good coding practices like modularizing the code into functions and methods each having their own clear and specific responsibilities.
